# CIA

The Secure Software Concepts domain encompasses essential principles from information security that are crucial for secure software development, including **confidentiality**, **integrity and** **availability** (CIA).

To fully describe operational security elements, authentication, authorization, auditability and nonrepudiation have been incorporated into the existing CIA framework.

* **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is only accessible to those with the proper authorization.
* **Integrity**: Maintaining the accuracy and reliability of data and systems, preventing unauthorized tampering or alterations.
* **Availability**: Ensuring that systems and data are consistently accessible and operational when needed.
* **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of users or entities accessing a system or data.
* **Authorization**: Granting or denying specific permissions and access rights to users or entities based on their authenticated identity.
* **Auditability**: The capability to track and record actions and events within a system for monitoring and accountability purposes.
* **Nonrepudiation**: Preventing individuals from denying their actions or transactions, ensuring accountability and trustworthiness.
